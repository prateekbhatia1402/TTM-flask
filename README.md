TTM (probably the laziest name i could have thought), is a time table management system that allows the users to, well , manage time table. it is designed keeping in mind the Indian schools and education institutions.
users with admin access can register new students, faculties and add new classes, subjects, rooms into the system while also being able to assign faculties and subject to classes. adding onto that, they can create time tables for classes.
other users like faculty and students can only view data while being able to update their username and password, keeping in note that faculties have access to slightly more data than students.
that's all TTM does. pretty boring right? actually it is. just storing some data in database while allowing users to access and manipulate it while doing authenication and authorization of users and ensuring data remains consistent. it is a very basic software.

but in this dull and boring system there is something pretty interesting, atleast for me it is. this is a basic feature that only admins can access yet it is for this basic feature only i decided to make the whole system.
admins while creating the time table for a class can click a button and the system will automatically complete the time table such that all requirements are met. admins can save it as such or make changes in it to make it perfect or get another suggession if they want.

So thats all,in one line i can say TTM let you create, update or view time table of classes and related fields while managing accounts of other users who can view all or some of this information.
